My first guide

I am a maintenance electrician in my early 30s.  I am hoping to get into a career that is easier on my body and one that can challenge me.  It can be intimidating to try and switch what you do when you have a mortgage and bills that won't take a month off so you can start anew.  I enjoy reading and learning, as well as staying fit.  I have a brown belt in brazillian jiu-jitsu and hope to someday get my black belt.
